I want you to build a production‑ready mobile app using React Native with Expo.
The app is a membership loyalty app and must target both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

Please follow these architecture and feature requirements:

1. Architecture and project structure
-Use an MVP (Model–View–Presenter) style architecture.

-Create a clear folder structure, for example:
--models/ for data models (Member, PointsBalance, Transaction, Coupon, etc.)
--views/ (or screens/) for React components that render UI and handle user input events
--presenters/ for presenter classes or modules containing screen logic
--services/ or api/ for all REST API calls and data access logic

-The View components must not contain business logic or direct API calls.

-The Presenter should:
--Receive events from the View (e.g. onLogin, onRedeemCoupon)
--Call the service/API layer
--Pass data or error states back to the View via clearly defined methods / props (e.g. showLoading, showError, renderPoints, renderCoupons).

2. Core features
a. User registration and login
-Users can register, log in, and log out using my existing backend HTTPS REST APIs (JSON).
-Authentication uses JWT or a session token returned by my backend.
-Store the auth token securely (e.g. using SecureStore or AsyncStorage) and attach it to every protected API request.

b. Points balance and transaction history
-After login, the user can see:
--Current points balance
--A list of past purchase transactions and how many points were earned for each transaction.

-All data must come from my existing REST APIs (read‑only on the client).
-Do not calculate points inside the app; just display the values returned by the API.

c. Coupon list and redemption
-A screen that shows available coupons for the logged‑in user, loaded from my REST API.
-When the user taps “Redeem”, call my redeem API with the member ID and coupon ID.
-Handle success and error responses and update the UI accordingly.
-After a successful redemption, show the coupon code or QR code returned by the API.

d. Push notifications (promotions)
-Integrate Expo Notifications / FCM so the app can receive promotional push notifications on Android and iOS.
-On first launch, ask the user for notification permission.
-When a device push token is generated, send it to my backend via an API so I can send targeted promotions later.

3. Multi‑language UI (Traditional Chinese default, Simplified Chinese, English)
-Implement localization using expo‑localization and a suitable i18n library (for example i18next or i18n‑js).
-Support three languages:
--zh-HK – Traditional Chinese (default)
--zh-CN – Simplified Chinese
--en – English

-On first launch, detect the device language and choose the best match, falling back to Traditional Chinese by default.
-Provide a Language screen in Settings where the user can manually switch language.
-Store the selected language (e.g. in AsyncStorage) and reuse it on the next app launch.

4. Screens and navigation
-Use React Navigation (or a similar library) for navigation with a clean structure.
-Required screens:
--Splash / Auto-login: check token, decide whether to go to Home or Login
--Login / Register
--Home: show points summary and key shortcuts
--Points / Transaction History
--Coupons: list + redeem flow
--Settings: language switch, notification toggle, logout

-Use a simple, modern UI with bottom tabs or another intuitive navigation pattern for the main sections.

5. API integration layer
-All data must come from my backend using HTTPS REST APIs with JSON.

-Create a dedicated service / API client layer (e.g. apiClient.ts) responsible for:
--Base URL configuration
--Attaching the auth token to headers when available
--Handling common errors (network errors, unauthorized, etc.).

-Use TypeScript interfaces or types for all request/response data models where possible.

6. Implementation details
-Start by scaffolding the complete project structure (folders, basic files, navigation, localization setup, and empty MVP wiring for each screen).

-Then implement basic working versions of the core flows:
--Login with dummy or placeholder endpoints
--Fetch and display points balance and a sample transaction list
--Display a coupon list and simulate a redeem call

-Use placeholder API endpoints and sample JSON models, but clearly mark all places where I must replace them with my real API URLs, request bodies, and response models (for example with // TODO: replace with real API comments).
-Add basic loading states, error handling, and simple input validation for forms.

Finally, please:
-Explain in comments or a short README how the MVP architecture is organized in this Expo project.
-Make the code clean and easy to extend so I can plug in my real REST APIs and business logic later.
